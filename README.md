# SOFT166

Intro:

This was a Uni project where i had to make a website that contained a tic tac toe game. The website had to also connect to a hue light located in a lab. I went for a scenario that i was a new indie game company called Rhodium Games.

Folders:

The Software it self is split into four folders. Index.html, script.js, style.css and HomePage.html. There are also two other folders that contain the photo used within the website and photos of the website in uses.

Index - This foler contains the use of a W3.CSS style sheet (design). All the css and Javascrip for the style sheet is located within the index.html page. There was also a photo added to the side bar that was gotten from Jing.fm. This page also contains my exta buttons and game that the user can play.

script.js - This contains all the scrip for the game. It will chack for winners, allow users to input there go and if a winner is picked it will display the players light on the Hue light located in a uni lab.

style.css - Within this style page there will be the thing i did, for example the display of the game grid.

HomePage - This page is mostly made up of the W3.CSS style sheet as the Indext page was. It contained the image from Jing.fm and a few about lines for my chosen scenario.

Photo - This conains the photo used within the project (credited at the bottom). It was a free to use photo.

Website Photo - Within here there are three other folders separating the three web browsers i used to test my project. Each photo has been labaled, it will show you that each feature (that can be shown) works as they are supposed to.
